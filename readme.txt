The code.cpp file contains the code.
It reads from the standard input three parameters: 
number of points n, dimension of the points d, and the desired number of clusters k.


Then from the input.csv it reads the points one by one.
Each point should be in one line and the coordinates should
be separated by a comma.

It appends to the file output.csv the following parameters in one line
n, d, k, 
number of critical balls, 
fairness of Jung et al.'s algorithm, 
cost of Jung et al.'s algorithm, 
fairness of the solution after the initialization step
cost of the solution after the initialization step
fairness of the local search algorithm
cost of the local search algorithm
